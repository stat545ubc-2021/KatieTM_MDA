## Updated October 18, 2021

This is the repository for the Mini data analysis (MDA) project for STAT 545A in the 2021 winter term. This project consists of 3 milestones, and has the overall goal of having students conduct an independent data analysis using tidy data principles and tools being taught concurrently in class.

### Milestone 1

* completed Oct 12, 2021
* explored potential datasets from the _datateachr_ package and chose the _vancouver_trees_ dataset for this mini data analysis
* performed 4 excercises to explore the dataset further using visualizations
* proposed 4 research questions to address with this dataset

### Milestone 2

* completed Oct 18, 2021
* summarized and visualized the _vancouver_trees_ dataset to investigate 4 different research questions
* evaluated whether the dataset was "tidy" given the research questions
* chose 2 of the 4 research questions to continue pursuing and created a tidy dataset that would allow these questions to be addressed

Details for Milestone 3 will be added once it is completed.

### Files
Each milestone is contained within a folder in the github repo, and contains the following files:

* __MDA_mX.Rmd__: 
  * R markdown file
  * Contains the code for each milestone of the project 
  * Can be ran using the knit function in Rstudio
* __MDA_mX.md__:

* __MDA_mX_files folder__:
